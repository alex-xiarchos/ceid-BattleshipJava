# ðŸ“Œ Battleship MiniGame - Java Project
> This repository contains my university coursework for a Java-created minigame, for the purposes of a course project at Object-oriented programming at CEID, University of Patras.


## ðŸ“œ About

- Turn-based logic with Player vs. AI mode, randomized moves that challenge the player and manual or automatic ship positioning
- Validation & Exception Handling: Ensures proper ship placement (no overlap, within board limits).
- Stat Tracking: Records successful hits, misses, and total shots.
